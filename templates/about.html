                <p>
                    Harvard Athletes play a major role in life at Harvard. Roughly 20% of the student body are athletes,
                    and many more engage in club sports. Make no mistake, being an athelete is a major time commitment.
                    Whether it be team lifts, team runs, team meetings, film study, practice, etc, athletics will find a way
                    to take time up in an athlete's day. This causes many time conflicts with office hours, lectures, and sections.
                    Many of which are either mandatory or not online. This raises the question: Do student-athletes
                    have a larger presence in certain concentrations? If this is the case, is it due to the fact that many
                    athletes have time commitments that interfere with their ability to concentrate in certain concentrations?
                    Being athletes ourselves, this question seems to be one worth answering.

                <p>
                   We used data from the Harvard Open Data Project which gave us
                   the concentration splits for undergraduate students at Harvard. We then formulated a data scraping
                   algorithm to go on the Harvard athletic websites and retrieve the concentration data for the athletes.
                   We also obtained all the times for concentration-specific classes and over-layed them with the concentration
                   data we retrieved from the athletic websites. Using Charts.js to make an interactive website, we hope to provide
                   the framework one needs to explore and analyze the disparity between the concentrations of student athletes, and the
                   rest of the student body.
