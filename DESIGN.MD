For designing our about and team page, we used Bootsrap 4. We used this because we thought that Bootstrap's grid component would be
really useful for creating our pages. The 12-column grid would be helpful in putting the pictures next to our bios.

For our data scraping algorithm, we used Beautiful Soup which is a Python library which allows us to get data from HTML files.
For conscrape.py, which allowed us to get the concentrations of each athlete, we first created a list to store URLs for each roster
page.
