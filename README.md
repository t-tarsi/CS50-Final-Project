# CS50-Final-Project
CS50 Final Project for Tyler Tarsi, Aaron Kruk, and LJ Barlow.

Concentration data taken from Harvard Open Data Project. Link: https://github.com/Harvard-Open-Data-Project/harvard-data/blob/master/concentrations-and-class-enrollment/Concentration%20Data.csv

HTML/Flask Skeleton taken from CS50 Finance.

Used Charts.js and modified it to have a more viewer friendly legend.


Our About page on our website gives more insight on our project. It tells about how we are trying to answer the question of if
student athletes concentrate more heavily in certain concentrations, and if so, is it because of time constraints. It also tells
about how we formulated the website and how we are giving the framework needed for one to answer the question.


Our Team page just gives a little introduction to each of our team members and tells a little about them. It has pictures of each of
us and a link to our respective athlete pages.


The Homepage shows the data visualization and is an interactive website. To create the data visualization, we used charts.js which
is a JavaScript library used to create visualization. We have two donut charts. The one on the left has every department and the
number of students concentrating in that concentration. The donut chart on the right is the same thing but for student-athletes.


To obtain the data, we used a data scraping algorithm to go through each athletic website and retrieve the concentration data
for each athlete on each team. We also used a data scraping algorithm to get data for every course time from the registar.
